# There are two reasons why this is split into another shell file:
# 1. the load phase needs to be ran at runtime, not build because otherwise it can't access the volume (therefore it's easier to have it a separate script rather than running all of it in the CMD statement)
# 2. the transaction phase fails when run in the CMD statement - for some reason the command gets interpreted wrong
